A simple php application demonstrating the basics of how to interact with
Amazon S3.  It requires the Crypt_HMAC and the HTTP_Request modules.  Note that
this program should only be run on a secure server owned by you, as it passes
the AWS Secret Access Key  as a query string parameter.  If this were to be
sniffed off the network or read from a log file, an attacker would be able to
act as you, perhaps maliciously.  It would be better to hard-code this into a
file readable only by the web server, or, better yet, from an encrypted file.
